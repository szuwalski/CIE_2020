# CIE_2020
Eastern Bering Sea snow crab assessment

# Instructions for use
The 2020 assessment for eastern Bering Sea snow crab can be reproduced with this repo. All folders beginning with a number contain model runs. Those with "_sq_" immediately after the number are the 'status quo' assessment. Those with "_gmacs_" after the number are performed with the General Model for Assessing Crustacean Stocks (GMACS). Data files have already been compiled and the models have already been run, but the source code and files necessary to run the assessment are in each of the folders. Some analyses have been pre-run, with output stored in 'plots' to save time knitting the assessment document. The assessment document can be produced by opening 'SAFE_document.Rmd' and knitting the file. That will produce "SAFE_document.pdf".
